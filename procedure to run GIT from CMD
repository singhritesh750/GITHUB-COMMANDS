1. Have an existing repository owned by anyone ( either you or someone else you'd like to contribute to) or, Create your own repository on GitHub

2. Cloning a repository:
   When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.
   Cloning can be done using 3 methods:
   a. using HTTPS CODE
   b. using SSH CODE
   c. using GitHub CLI CODE

   Cloning a repository using the command line
   1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page (username/repo_name) of the repository.
   2. Above the list of files, click GREEN CLONE CODE.
   3. To clone the repository USE ANY ONE OF THE CLONING METHODS i.e., using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link given there.
   4. Open Git Bash or CMD
   5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be present e.g., Desktop.
   6. git clone [paste the URL copied in git] -> to create your local clone e.g., git clone https://github.com/singhritesh750/GITHUB-COMMANDS.git

3. On your computer, move the file you'd like to upload to GitHub into the local directory that was created when you cloned the repository.
4. Open Git Bash or CMD, Change the current working directory to your local repository.
5. git add . -> Adds the file to your local repository and stages it for commit or in other words Stage the file for commit to your local repository
   git reset HEAD [YOUR-FILE] -> To unstage a file
6. git commit -m "Add whatever you want to show as content of README.md" -> Commit the file that you've staged in your local repository or Commits the tracked changes and 
                                                                            prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository.
   git reset --soft HEAD~1 -> To remove this commit and modify the file, use the command and commit and add the file again.

*** NOTES: if Running "git push origin your-branch" to Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub, after the "6." command shows the error then go to "7." instead e.g.,
           git push origin https://github.com/singhritesh750/repository_name.git -> fatal: invalid refspec 'https://github.com/singhritesh750/GITHUB-COMMANDS.git'

7. git branch -M main
8. git remote add origin https://github.com/singhritesh750/repository_name.git" 
9. Pushing commits to a remote repository:
   Use git push to push commits made on your LOCAL BRANCH to a REMOTE REPOSITORY.
   The git push command takes two arguments:
    1. REMOTE name, for example, origin
    2. LOCAL name, for example, main
    e.g., git push <REMOTENAME> <LOCALNAME> -> git push origin main -> to push your local changes to your online repository.
   
   ***NOTES: if Running "git push origin https://github.com/singhritesh750/repository_name.git" -> fatal: invalid refspec 'https://github.com/singhritesh750/GITHUB-COMMANDS.git' 
             then run the below command.
             
   git push -u origin main -> to push the file into the Git. Here the file finally gets uploaded to git
